### Welcome To Our Blitz Camp Site 


- This is a summer camp sports base website

- First we make navbar footer then we do authentication and login sign up system so that if a user wants to select any class of our website then he has to sign up and select our website.

- Then on home page we show popular classes , popular instructor and learn about us section banai who has enrolled in any class and any instructor's class.

- Then we toggle to 3 categories of the dashboard such as this site will be used in 3 ways such as: User, Admin, Instructor Those who will log in normally are students, those who will upload the classes and handle the classes are instructors and everything will be handled by the admin

- If a student goes to the dashboard then it will show him his category route in proportion to his status, similarly admin and instructor will show his category route in proportion to their status.

- When a student selects a class, we show it in Route in My Classes and if that student wants to enroll, he can click on the pay button. Enrolled in class and shown in enrollment route

- Then instructors can upload their various sports related classes. However, after uploading it, the status of the class will be pending until the admin approves it, and students will not be able to view this class.

- And admin handles all the users and can approve and deny the uploaded classes and can make any user an admin, instructor and can also delete them.
